* FLEETING GFP Flags                                             :gfp:memory:
  The [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/memory-allocation.html][GFP flags]] control allocators behavior. GFP means "get free pages".
* PERMANENT GFP_NOIO/GFP_NOFS
  GPF_NOIO/GPF_NOFS is one of the GFP flags, which is used to prevent recursion deadlocks caused by direct memory
  reclaim calling back into the FS or IO paths and blocking on already held resources.

  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  A GFP_NOFS allocation is not allowed to perform any filesystem calls, while GFP_NOIO disallows the initiation of any
  I/O at all. They are used primarily in the filesystem and virtual memory code where an allocation may be allowed to
  sleep, but recursive filesystem calls would be a bad idea.
