* PERMANENT Introduction                              :performance:benchmark:
[[https://github.com/gormanm/mmtests][MMTests]] is a configurable test suite that runs performance test against arbitrary workloads.
* PERMANENT Tutorials                                 :performance:benchmark:
The ~run-mmtest.sh~ is the main entry point. It reads a configure file. After running multiple tests, we can use
~compare-mmtests.pl~ to compare results, which will generate a report with differnt formats.

** PERMANENT Configure
All available configurations are stored in ~configs~.

Some options are universal:

  * ~MMTESTS~: A list of what tests will be run.
  * ~AUTO_PACKAGE_INSTALL~: yes/no
  * ~MMTESTS_NUMA_POLICY~: decide NUMA policy. This will be the most concerned option.
* FLEETING Configure About NUMA                                        :NUMA:
The value of ~MMTESTS_NUMA_POLICY~ is related to ~numad~ and ~numactl~.
** numad
[[https://linux.die.net/man/8/numad][numad]] is a user-level daemon that provides placement advice and process management for efficient use of CPUs and memory
on systems with NUMA topology.
