** PERMANENT ABSTRACT
   The containers are the way-to-go. VMWare and KVM perform similarly on most of the benchmark.
   
** PERMANENT INTRODUCTION
   This article study the architectures of virtualization systems and provides a quantitative evalution of the
   performance that can be achieved against IO-intensive, memory-intensive, and compute-intensive benchmarks. It also
   evaluate the overhead introduced by virtualization against native executions.
